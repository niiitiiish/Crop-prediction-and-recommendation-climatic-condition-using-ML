- Crop prediction based on custom environmental input

---

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- The dataset contains agricultural records with the following features:
  - **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, **Potassium (K)**
  - **Temperature** (Â°C), **Humidity** (%)
  - **pH Level**
  - **Rainfall** (mm)
  - **Label**: Recommended Crop (e.g., rice, maize, cotton)

## ðŸ§  Model Used

The main model used in this project is the **Random Forest Classifier**, an ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their predictions for improved accuracy and robustness.

- **Advantages of Random Forest:**
  - Effectively handles high dimensional data.
  - Reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees.
  - Provides feature importance to identify key influencing factors.

Other models that can be explored include:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest was selected for its superior performance on this dataset.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

- Achieved over **98% accuracy** on test data.
- Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization includes feature distributions, correlation heatmaps, and confusion matrices.
